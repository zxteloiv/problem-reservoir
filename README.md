A CRUD system designed to help teachers compile a test.

## How to Use

This system needs PHP and CodeIgniter. It is deployed using Nginx but it will run under any PHP server theoretically.

The CodeIgniter version 3.0.2 code is also distributed here. You must copy prs and system folders to your own web root.

Further configuration can be modified in the `prs/index.php` file, which may allow you to put these two folders somewhere else.

Access the home page by something like `http://localhost/prs/`.
